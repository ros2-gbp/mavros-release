# MAVROS Examples

## Overview

The **`mavros_examples`** package is a comprehensive educational resource that provides an extensive collection of hands-on demonstrations showcasing the correct implementation of **MAVROS** services and topics within the **ROS 2** ecosystem. This package is specifically designed for individuals who are **taking their first steps with MAVROS** or seeking to **deepen their understanding** of how to establish effective communication with autopilot systems—whether running **ArduPilot** or **PX4** firmware—through standardized ROS interfaces. As the MAVROS framework continues to evolve through active development, numerous topics and services have been **deprecated, renamed, or structurally modified** over time. This ongoing evolution often presents challenges for newcomers, who may struggle to find up-to-date, functional examples that comply with the **latest API specifications and best practices**. To bridge this gap, the `mavros_examples` package serves as both a **pedagogical tool** and a **practical reference library**, enabling users to quickly gain proficiency in using MAVROS with ROS 2. By providing **well-documented and verified code samples** aligned with current standards, the package minimizes the learning curve and prevents the frustration associated with outdated or incompatible example code. Whether you are **developing your first drone application**, **exploring MAVROS for research or simulation**, or **transitioning from ROS 1 to ROS 2**, this package offers a clear, structured path to mastering MAVROS concepts and implementing reliable communication patterns with your flight controller.
